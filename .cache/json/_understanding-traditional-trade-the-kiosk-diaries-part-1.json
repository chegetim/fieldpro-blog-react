However, it would be a mistake to assume that just because Kawangware is a slum, it doesn’t function like other urban centres in Kenya. As we get ready to kick-start our interviews, people continue approaching the shops to make their purchases: kids buy sweets and parents stock up on basic essentials. Since roughly 80% of retail sales across Kenya, and more generally sub-Saharan Africa, take place in traditional outlets (such as these kiosks), our mission today is to gain a better insight into the day-to-day operations of these outlets, as well as the key challenges they face.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Who are the kiosk owners?","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"heading-2"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"After carrying out in-depth interviews with three kiosk-owners in Kawangware, we got a better insight regarding who these kiosks owners actually are.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Gilbert Hamis is 33 year old man.

On a normal day, he opens the shop early before going to work, around 6am.

Francis says him and his wife are very happy with the operation of their businesses. However, this doesn’t stop them from having high hopes for the future.

Customers complain that, in two subsequent months, they can pay vastly different prices for the same products. However, this issue is completely out of Ann’s control. Fluctuations in prices are driven by sudden changes in international and national trading policies, as well as environmental shocks, such as drought. When prices are high, not only are her customers unhappy, but they are also unable to afford her products. For this reason, Ann sometimes finds herself in situations where, to retain business, she is forced to give her clients products on credit.
