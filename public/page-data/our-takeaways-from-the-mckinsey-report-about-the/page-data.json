Moreover, adopting a proactive approach can be the first step to get more involved in the ecosystem, for example, experimenting with smart partnerships. Companies in the industry can engage in targeted partnerships with strategic digital solutions providers that complement their existing distribution systems and that have minimal channel conflict.
