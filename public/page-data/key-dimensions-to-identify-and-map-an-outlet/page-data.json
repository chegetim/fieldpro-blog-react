It lays out the foundation on which you can afterwards perform a segmentation of the outlets, define the territories, the sales infrastructure required to cover this territory, in terms of distributors, sales rep, etc. Traditional trade in Africa is made up of small shops that operate on small capitalisation, and can therefore go bankrupt, or close because of seasonality effect (agents closing to go harvesting for example). While some companies will contract an external agency to do a one-time census exercise, we believe it is better to run it internally leveraging a software solution provided to the field agents to be able to constantly update it. The only justification of having an external eye on it is if the current sales teams are too busy focusing on sales, and need to be challenged with an external objective view on the universe size.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"From our experience, these are the key dimensions that need to be collected when identifying a retailer on the field:","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Shop name","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Outside / Inside picture","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Type of shop.
