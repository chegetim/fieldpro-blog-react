Every day, millions of sales representatives set off on foot along their predefined routes visiting outlets one by one to (a) promote new products and give promotions, (b) get orders from these outlets, © delivery previously ordered products, and/or (d) provide shops with merchandising materials. Companies like Unilever and Coca-Cola tend to have a tight control and oversight regarding these field operations.

Since these outlets need to be visited at least once a week to ensure they maintain adequate stock levels across outlets, the company’s sales reps (or their distributors) have to carry out 0.5 M retail visits weekly. 1 sales rep can visit 20 outlets in 1 day, and each sales rep is paid about $15 a day. This means that per year, the FMCG company (or associated distributors) spend $19.5M paying its 5000 sales reps. However, the system is inefficient because most of its sales occur in a limited number of outlets. If visits by sales reps were targeted to when shops are actually out of stock and thus willing to buy, the number of weekly visits to outlets and the annual expenditure on sales reps would half to 0.25M and $9.75M, respectively. This would not only translated into a significant reduction in annual cost for the FMCG company, it would also fundamentally drive down the price for the kiosk owner and end consumer.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"odk6x8y34ibq","contentful_id":"odk6x8y34ibq"}},"id":"c1Ic8W5HWGpJgVlRP26e4bc","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-12-02T08:48:45.700Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-02T08:48:45.700Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":1,"contentful_id":"1Ic8W5HWGpJgVlRP26e4bc"},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"distribution-inefficiencies-the-kiosk-2"},"file":{"en-US":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/odk6x8y34ibq/1Ic8W5HWGpJgVlRP26e4bc/c33a8d88ed6459726813111af73a2ecd/0_X48sfFKJJBzhbveE.jpeg","details":{"size":12132,"image":{"width":300,"height":169}},"fileName":"0_X48sfFKJJBzhbveE.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Shortages of stock are a common problem among kiosks.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Together, these two phenomena have a huge repercussion on the overall success of inclusive business strategies that target the BoP.
